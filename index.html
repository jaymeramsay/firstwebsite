    <div class="bio">
        <p class="bioinfo">I was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1982, but grew up in the suburbs. I'm a big sister. I was named after Jaime Summers, the Bionic Woman. I taught myself
          how to play the drums when I was eleven. I moved to Austin on New Year's 2005 where I started a career in theater. I was also a pre-K montessori school teacher for five
          years. I currently reside in Barton Hills. I have no pets. Oh! And I recently found my father :)
        </p>

        <p2 class="bioinfotwo">Music and theater are passions of mine. I'm a performance artist with copious amounts of experience in many forms: burlesque, mime, clown, mask, scripted, unscripted/improvised, and puppetry.
          I can't stand cilantro or licorice. I don't like the Beatles, but Huey Lewis and the News are pretty great. I suck at gardening and geography, but I'm really good at dancing and conversing. I enjoy gaming.
         I'm a leo. My house is Gryffindor. I'm an elf and a jedi. I'm more magic than melee. I love science!

    <div class="bandbio">
      <h1 class="bandtitle">I'm in a band!</h1>
      <p class="bandinfo">We are a puppet-fronted emo band called Fragile Rock. I play drums! We've been together almost three years, and just cut our first full length album last month.
      We also debuted SXSW 2017 and appeared on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert.</p>

        <p>Marc is my heart. We're pretty gross together. This October will be our 5th anniversary. Together we've done many things: travel, perform on stage, direct improvised plays, host events, run and play games, protest, and a lot more. If it wasn't for him,
      I wouldn't be here at Galvanize pursuing a career in software engineering. He has given me enough encouragement and confidence to make such a big change in my life, and well, he kinda does this a lot for me. Thank you, Marc!
